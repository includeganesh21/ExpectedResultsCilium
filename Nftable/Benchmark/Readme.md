# nftables vs iptables: Performance Benchmark Summary

This document summarizes real-world benchmark findings and comparisons between `nftables` and `iptables`.

---

## ðŸ”¬ 1. Red Hat Developer Benchmark (2017)

In a comprehensive study by Red Hat, it was observed that:

- `iptables` performance degrades linearly with the number of custom chains.
- `nftables` scales more efficiently and offers better performance as the rule-set size grows.
- With 50 rule jumps, `nftables` already outperforms `iptables` in mean performance.

## ðŸ“Š 2. Academic Study: Latency and Throughput Comparison

A detailed academic paper compared the latency and throughput of `iptables` and `nftables` using various rule-set sizes and frame sizes.

Key findings:
- With linear look-ups, `nftables` performs worse than `iptables` for small frame sizes and large rule sets.
- When using indexed data structures, `nftables` performance improves and can outperform `iptables` in certain scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- **Data Structures**: `nftables` leverages efficient data structures (e.g., sets, maps) allowing for faster rule matching.
- **Scalability**: In environments with large and complex rule sets, `nftables` offers better scalability and performance.
- **Modern Features**: Provides a unified framework for IPv4/IPv6, stateful filtering, and simplified firewall management.

# nftables vs iptables: Performance and Architecture Benchmark

This document compares **nftables** with **iptables** in terms of performance, scalability, and efficiency, especially in real-world Kubernetes and CNI scenarios.

## ðŸ” Key Differences

| Feature                 | iptables                      | nftables                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Backend mechanism       | Linked list of rules          | Optimized pseudo-stateful engine |
| Evaluation time         | O(N) â€” linear rule matching   | O(1) â€” optimized using maps/sets |
| Rule insertion/deletion | Slower with large rule sets   | Much faster                       |
| Kernel dependency       | Uses legacy netfilter         | Uses `nf_tables` (modern)         |
| Expression optimization | No                            | Yes (compiled rules)             |

## ðŸš€ Why nftables Scales Better

1. **Rule Storage:** Rules are stored in maps, not chains â€” lookups are hash-based instead of linear scan.
2. **Transaction-based Configuration:** Atomic rule changes ensure no race conditions.
3. **Replaces Multiple Tools:** nftables replaces `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `arptables`, and `ebtables`.

## ðŸ›  Performance Testing Tools

You can use tools like:

- `nft bench` (in development)
- `netperf`
- `iperf3`
- `nftables monitor` (with `tcpdump` or `bpftrace`)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

For high-performance container environments and CNI like Cilium:
- nftables offers **O(1) matching**, better memory handling, and **atomic updates**, outperforming iptables.
- Migrating to nftables is becoming more common with modern Linux distros.
